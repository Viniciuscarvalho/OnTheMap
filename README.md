# OnTheMap

An iOS Project using Swift and iOS 9.3. Last project of Udacity Nanodegree Course. Funds were used to store the data with [Parse](www.parse.com) to sync data to the log. Next we are shown the registered students in the backend that are near you in map view and there is also possibility to see the list of students in the tabbar menu.
